openvv
======

## Getting Started
* Clone the repository and cd into the root directory of it.
* Set the environment variable FLEX_HOME on your system, e.g. 

```
export FLEX_HOME=/Applications/flex_sdk_4.6
```
in your /etc/.profile or ~/.profile on Mac OS X, or Unix-like systems.  My Computer > Advanced System Properties > Environment variables on Windows systems.

* You need Apache ANT to go forward. If you don't have it, you can install it from [the official website](http://ant.apache.org/)

## Build the SWC Library and the Beacons

* Run this from the root directory of OpenVV. It will create new files `bin/openvv.swc` and `bin/OVVBeacon.swf`:

```
ant
```

* Incorporate the SWC `bin/openvv.swc` into your project
* Move the newly created `bin/Beacon.swf` to a publicly accessible web location.


###### Alternatively if you are on Mac OS X or another Unix-like platform that supports bash, you can run

```
./build.sh
```

Which has the added benefit of including the current git commit id in a trace statement so your build of OpenVV will report its version at runtime.   This is useful for "production" builds on a CI system.  

###### You can also build the components independently:

* Build the SWC Library:

```    
ant compile-lib
```

* Build the Beacons

```
ant compile-beacon
```


## Initialize OpenVV 
* Instantiate `OVVAsset` and pass the URL of your Beacon in:
```actionscript
var asset:OVVAsset = new OVVAsset('http://localhost/OVVBeacon.swf');
```
* Get viewability data at any time by calling `OVVAsset.checkViewability()`.
```actionscript
var check:OVVCheck = asset.checkViewability();
```
* Query the properties of the `OVVCheck` object to report on your player's viewability.

The properties are:

* <code>viewabilityState</code>: string Indicates whether or not the asset is viewable. Possible values are "viewable", "unviewable", "unmeasurable"
* <code>clientHeight</code>: int Current height of the client
* <code>clientWidth</code>: int Current width of the client
* <code>focus</code>: boolean Whether or not the tab and browser are in focus
* <code>objBottom</code>: int Y position of the bottom edge of the embed object
* <code>objLeft</code>: int X position of the left edge of the embed object
* <code>objRight</code>: int X position of the right edge of the embed object
* <code>objTop</code>: intY position of the top edge of the embed object
* <code>percentViewable</code>:int The percentage of the embed object's area that is calculated to be in view


3rd party integration
==========================

Allows 3rd parties to easily provide video viewability measurement by exposing the VPAID data as well as the viewability data via a JavaScript API.  The release extends the functionality of OVVAsset.as for it to be used as the base class for integrating openvv into SWF Ads.

## Demo
A working demo based on the openvv demo is available here: http://video.doubleverify.com
## Overview
The addition to OVVAsset.as includes an **initEventsWiring** and **addJavaScriptResourceOnEvent** methods to be use for third parties integrations as follow:

1.  Instantiate an OVVAsset object and pass it a unique identifier. 
2.  Registers OVVAsset.as as an event listener to VPAID events fired by the creative using **initEventsWiring** function passing the EventDispatcher that Fires IVPAID events.
3.  Call **addJavaScriptResourceOnEvent** function with the VPAID event name upon the JavaScript tag should be rendered and the JavaScript tag url.

Code snippet:
```actionscript
public function initAd(width:Number, height:Number, viewMode:String, desiredBitrate:Number, creativeData:String, environmentVars:String):void 
{
   ...
  _viewabilityAsset = new OVVAsset('http://domain.com/OVVBeacon.swf', guid);      
  // call initEventWiring with this to register asset as listener to VPAID events
  _viewabilityAsset.initEventsWiring(this);             
  // Load 3rd party tags. Use **adID** to pass the asset ID
  var tagSrc:String = "http://someUrl.com/3rdPartyTag.js?adID=" + guid;     
  _viewabilityAsset.addJavaScriptResourceOnEvent(VPAIDEvent.AdImpression, tagSrc);
  ...
}
```

### JavaScript
1.  Subscribe to events on $ovv to receive viewability/VPAID data.

Code snippet:
```javascript
$ovv.subscribe('AdImpression', playerID, function(event, id, args) {
    ...
});
```

###Understanding the data
The javascript event will receive the args {"vpaidData":vpaidData, "ovvData":ovvData}
####vpaidData:
The vpaid event data if passed from the vpaid event otherwise null.
####ovvData: 

```

True means the beacon was viewable and false means the beacon was unviewable. Beacon 0 is the "control beacon" and should always be false",

####Fuisz Media .swc build
Once you have successfully installed openvv by following the directions above, you can customize your `build.xml` to allow you to save your `openvv.swc` to your `/lib/` folder of your as3vpaid project.

* In your `build.xml` under the line that says: 


`<property name="FLEX_HOME" value="${env.FLEX_HOME}"/>`

add another line that says:

`<property name ="FUISZ_AS3_VPAID" value="${env.FUISZ_AS3_VPAID}"/>`

This is the global environment variable that points to the path of your AS3 VPAID directory.

*  In the same build.xml, scroll down to the following line:

`<compc output="${bin.dir}/openvv.swc"` and change it to reflect the newly created `FUISZ_AS3_VPAID` property. _Example_: 

`<compc output="${FUISZ_AS3_VPAID}/openvv.swc"`

* Save the build.xml file

* Open your ./bash_profile on your mac (or windows/linux equivlanet) and add the following line: `export FUISZ_AS3_VPAID="[PATH TO AS3 VPAID REPO]/lib"`

That's it! Next time you run `ant`, in the command line, the openvv.swc will be saved in your as3-vpaidn `/lib/` directory.
